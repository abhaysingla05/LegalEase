# LegalEase

## Problem Statement
LegalEase addresses the challenge of creating a text summarization system for legal documents that not only generates concise summaries but also allows users to ask questions in natural language. By making legal materials accessible and interactive, LegalEase bridges the gap between legal professionals and the general public, enhancing awareness and understanding of legal texts.

- **Simplified Legal Texts**: Ensure that simplified legal texts are easily understandable for a wide range of users, including legal professionals, laypersons, and individuals with varying levels of literacy.
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Develop interfaces that facilitate intuitive interaction.
- **Research Tools**: Provide tools and resources that assist researchers in navigating and synthesizing legal information effectively, enhancing productivity in legal research tasks.

## Features
- **Summarization**: Advanced NLP algorithms to create summaries of legal documents.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Natural language processing to answer user questions within the document context.
- **Jargon Explanation**: Simplification of legal jargon to make documents more accessible.
